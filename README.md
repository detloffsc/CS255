Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was designing a system that helped people prepare for driving tests. The main function of the site was to connect users with drivers so that they could get practice time driving. Users would sumbit a request for a time to drive then a driver in their area would accept that request. The user could also find current rules and information set by the DMV and take practice written tests all from the website.

What did you do particularly well?
I think that I handled the design portion well. I felt that I had a good understanding of what the site aimed to do and provided a system desiegn that was engaging and easy to use while sticking to the requirements.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think the overall communication of my ideas could have been done better. Especially with the different kinds of diagrams I was not always able to communicate everything that I wanted to.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
User's needs are important when designing a system because they are the core of what the system is built for. If a systen is built without a user's needs in mind it will end up not being a good system. I kept them at the forefront of my mind, always asking myself "how does my design fulfill a need of the user". 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I have mixed feelings about designing software. I think that they can be helpful tools but I do not enjoy using them. While this is something that I need to grow in, I prefer to jump in and try things. I like the process of trying and adjusting more than spending time in design software.
